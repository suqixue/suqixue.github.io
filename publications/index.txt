16:T459,Abstract. Chondrosarcoma ofthe Pelvis is one of the most challenging tumors forthe orthopaedic surgeon. Clinically, imaging modalities represented by Magneticresonance imaging (MRl) are the regular approach for diagnosing Chondrosar-coma. In this paper, to further improve the automation of diagnosis and mine thecomplementary clinical information from high-dimensional features, we proposea pelvic chondrosarcoma identification model based on MRI radiomics features.Specifically, radiomic features, such as first-order, shape, and texture, are initiallyextracted, and then a subset ofthese features are selected based on the least absoluteshrinkage sum selection operator (LASSO) analysis. Subsequently, a recursive fea-ture elimination (RFE) algorithm is utilized to select the most significant features.The prediction results are finally obtained through the constructed multivariatelogistic regression model. Experiments conducted on clinical data achieved thearea under curve (AUC) of 98.1% on testing set, demonstrating the effectivenessof the proposed MRI-based model for identifying pelvic chondrosarcoma.17:T671,@inproceedings{xue2024chondrosarcoma,

}18:T598,Repeatability is an important attribute of motor unit number index (MUNIX) technologyThis paper proposes an optimal contraction force combination for MUNlX calculation in an effort toimprove the repeatability ofthis technology. In this study, the surface electromyography(EMG) signalsof the biceps brachii muscle of eight healthy subjects were initially recorded with high-density surfaceelectrodes, and the contraction strength was the maximum voluntary contraction force of nineprogressive levels. Then, by traversing and comparing the repeatability of MUNlX under variouscombinations of contraction force, the optimal combination of muscle strength is determined. Finally.calculate MUNIX using the high-density optimal muscle strength weighted average method. Thecorrelation coefficient and the coefiicient of variation are utilized to assess repeatability. The results showthat when the muscle strength combination is 10, 20, 50 and 70% ofthe maximum yoluntary contractionforce, the repeatability of MUNlX is greatest, and the correlation between MUNIX calculated using thiscombination of muscle strength and conventional methods is high (PCC > 0.99), the repeatability of theMUNIX method improved by 11.5-23.8%. The results indicate that the repeatability of MUNIX differsfor various combinations of muscle strength and that UNIX, which is measured with a smaller numberand lower-level contractility, has greater repeatability.19:T775,@article{xu2023evaluation,

}1a:T740,Abstract: To enhance the reproducibility of motor unit number index (MUNX)for evaluatingneurological disease progression, this paper proposes a negative entropy-based fast independencomponent analysis (FastICA) demixing method to assess MUNlX reproducibility in the presence of interchannel mixing of electromyography (EMG) signals acquired by high-density electrodes. First, compositesurface EMG (sEMG) signals were obtained using high-density surface electrodes. Second, the FastICAalgorithm based on negative entropy was employed to determine the orthogonal projection matrix thatminimizes the negative entropy of the projected signal and effectively separates mixed sEMG signalsFinally, the proposed experimental approach was validated by introducing an interrelationship criterion toquantify independence between adjacent channel EMG signals, measuring MUNIX repeatability usingcoefficient of variation (CV), and determining motor unit number and size through MUNIX. Resultsanalysis shows that the inclusion of the full (128) channel sEMG information leads to a reduction in CVvalue by 15+0.1 and a linear decline in CV value with an increase in the number of channels. Thecorrelation between adjacent channels in participants decreases by 0.12+0.05 as the number ofchannelsgradually increases. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of interrelationshipsbetween sEMG signals following negative entropy-based FastICA processing, compared to the mixedsElMG signals, Moreover, this decrease in interrelationships becomes more pronounced with an increasingnumber of channels. Additionally, the CV of MUNIX gradually decreases with an increase in the numberof channels, thereby optimizing the issue of abnormal MUNlX repeatability patterns and further enhancingthe reproducibility of MUNIX based on high-density surface EMG signals.1b:Ta7e,@article{xue2023munix,
